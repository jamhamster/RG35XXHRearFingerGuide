# RG35XXHRearFingerGuide

This is an SVG file of a rear trigger guide designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic to make long term play more comfortable.

It'll help to round the edges a little with some sandpaper (or 3d print one with a chamfer). I recommend that you stick it on the back with NanoTape as this will make it adjustable.

Have fun! :-)
